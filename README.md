# Autonomous QA

**Software quality assurance aims to make sure that software behaves as expected.  Autonomous QA strives to automate the testing process to reduce time and improve the accuracy and repeatability of testcases.**  First, consider all the risks that your software will encounter.  Make a list of risks in a risk register.  Evaluate each risk.  Think about how often the risky situation occurs.  Consider how big the problem will be if the risk does occur.  Look at how easy it is to find the risky situation.  Rank each risk so you can tackle the biggests risks first.  Think about how you can prevent or deal with the biggest risks.  

One way to deal with risks, is to test the software by entering valid and invalid input.  You do this by creating testcases.  Testcases help find bugs so developers can fix them.    You repeat the tests until you prove that the software behaves as expected in situation being tested by the testcase.

### Using Python and Selenium to automate software testcases
You can use Python and Selenium to automate web browsers and to control the testcase and report results.  Here are some simple examples to get started:
